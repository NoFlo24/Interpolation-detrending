# Interpolation-detrending
1. This project reads in a csv file of neuroscience data, and then plots x versus y on a line graph. 
2. The user is then prompted to enter in the amount of points they want to add which summarize the graph data.
3. After the user specifies how many points they want to add, they are then prompted to enter in the x and y coordinates of each point on the graph.
4. An interpolated line is then formed by connecting those same data points together.
5. The interpolated line of the data is then subtracted from the data itself to obtain a new, corrected, and detrended graph. This detrended graph now shows us the true relationship between behavior and mice neural activity.
